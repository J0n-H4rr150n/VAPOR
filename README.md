## üå´Ô∏è Overview

Welcome to **VAPOR Lab (Vulnerable AI Penetration & Operations Research)**!

This repository is designed as a comprehensive, hands-on learning environment for security enthusiasts, researchers, and aspiring AI Application Security Engineers. The goal is to dive deep into the principles of securing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems. Drawing inspiration from renowned projects like OWASP's "Goat" series and "Damn Vulnerable Web Application," VAPOR Lab provides a modular, locally-focused, and ethically sound platform to explore common vulnerabilities in both traditional ML models and modern Large Language Models (LLMs).

The lab is structured through progressive phases, guiding you from foundational local setup to building, attacking, and securing vulnerable AI applications. It also covers integration with cloud environments (AWS Free Tier) and fundamental DevOps/MLOps security practices. The core philosophy emphasizes a "local first," open-source approach, fostering a deep understanding through practical, hands-on experimentation.

## üî¨ Lab Structure & Phases

VAPOR Lab is organized into distinct phases, each building upon the last:

* **Phase 1: Foundational Local Setup (`Phase-1.md`)**
    * Setting up the Kali Linux environment (or similar).
    * Installing essential tools: Python, Git, Conda, Docker, VS Code.
    * Configuring the development workspace.
* **Phase 2: Core AI Security Learning Modules (`Phase-2.md`)**
    * **Traditional ML Security:** Data poisoning, evasion attacks, model integrity, basic MLOps security with DVC and MLflow.
    * **LLM Security:** Deep dive into OWASP LLM Top 10 vulnerabilities, advanced prompt injection, practicing with local LLMs (Ollama) and PortSwigger labs.
* **Phase 3: Full-Stack Application & Local Orchestration (`Phase-3.md`)**
    * Developing a "Fake Loan Site" frontend (HTML, CSS, JS).
    * Building a backend AI model API (Flask/FastAPI).
    * Dockerizing both frontend and backend.
    * Orchestrating the multi-container application locally using Docker Compose.
* **Phase 4: Cloud Integration & DevOps Practices (`Phase-4.md`)**
    * Integrating with AWS Free Tier services (EC2, S3, ECR, Lambda, API Gateway).
    * Gaining hands-on experience with Kubernetes (K8s) using Minikube/Kind.
    * Implementing a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated building, testing, and deployment.
* **Phase 5: Advanced AI Hacking & Research Integration (`Phase-5.md`)**
    * Incorporating cutting-edge techniques and findings from AI security researchers and bug bounty hunters.
    * Applying holistic AI assessment methodologies.
* **Phase 6 (Future):** *(Outline for potential future expansion)*
    * Advanced MLOps Security.
    * Federated Learning Security.
    * Real-world AI incident case studies and replications.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git)
    cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
    ```
2.  **Begin with Phase 1:** Open `Phase-1.md` and follow the checklist to set up your foundational environment.
3.  **Progress Sequentially:** Work through each `Phase-X.md` file. They contain detailed checklists, including commands and guidance.
4.  **Document Your Journey:** Use a tool like Obsidian (as planned) or any note-taking app to track your progress, learnings, and any challenges you overcome.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions, feedback, and suggestions are highly encouraged to make VAPOR Lab a more robust and valuable resource! Please feel free to:

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch for your feature or fix (`git checkout -b feature/YourAmazingFeature`).
3.  Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add some YourAmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourAmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a Pull Request.

Please ensure your contributions align with the lab's educational goals and ethical principles.
